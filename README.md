# lexTALE_jsPsych

Sharing my conversion of the [LexTALE test](www.lextale.com) to work with version7.+ of [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/).

The look + feel of the script is similar to the test as displayed on www.lextale.com, although I'm sure it's not necessary for the test to look like this!

The final score is stored in the jsPsych data as `lextale_score`
